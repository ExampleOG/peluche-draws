Hello, today I want to share a bit about my

00:00:02.297 --> 00:00:04.836
experience creating an animation. To

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.810
start, I have to say this is an easy job,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.825
but somewhat laborious,

00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.605
because you need to make several drawings

00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:13.741
just for a small movement. In

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.796
this case, in the background video, you can

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:18.375
see the steps I took to create the drawings

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:21.478
and how I built the animation. Once I added

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:23.493
color to the PokÃ©mon's bodies, I

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:25.467
focused on creating different drawings of the

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:26.999
tails to create the animation

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.014
effect. Then I created the background and added

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:29.658
details.
